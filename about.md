I'm Arthur, sometimes `afm`, `splessnosi`, `sybilresistant`

I like to think that decentralization of resources and power will improve collective decision making and human life. I also like to think that it's possible to design systems to achieve that, using math and engineering.

Thanks for checking out my sick HTML and markdown skills!
